        To fight diseases of aging, scientist makes aging itself the target by Wayne Lewis, UCLA
        When Dr. Ming Guo says that she wants to reverse the aging process, she’s not outlining a 
        fantastical quest for the Fountain of Youth. She’s looking for ways to defeat incurable diseases.

      <p>
        “If we could pause, delay or even reverse aging, we would make a significant impact against 
        numerous diseases,” said Guo, professor of neurology, molecular and medical pharmacology at 
        the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “I want to create a higher quality of life over 
        a healthy life span, rather than just prolonging life.”

        First case of HIV cure in a woman after stem cell transplantation reported at CROI-2022, source: WHO official webpage
      </h4>
      <p>
        The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trial Network (IMPAACT) P1107 reported the 
        first case of HIV cure in a woman living with HIV submitted to a dual stem cell transplant 
        (i.e., an umbilical cord blood transplant combined with a half-matched bone marrow transplant) 
        for treatment of an acute myelogenous leukemia. The IMPAACT P1107 researchers presented the case details 
        during the oral abstract session held at the 29th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2022). 
        The study participant is a woman from New York (USA) who stopped antiretroviral therapy (ART) at 37 months 
        post-transplant and has had no HIV detected for 14 months. The dual stem cell therapy also led to remission 
        from leukemia that she developed in 2017.
